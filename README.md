# Unclosed HTML Element Bug

This repository demonstrates a common HTML error: an unclosed element.  Unclosed elements can lead to unexpected rendering and layout issues in web browsers.  The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected version.

## How to Reproduce

1. Open `bug.html` in a web browser.
2. Observe the unexpected layout or behavior caused by the unclosed element.
3. Open `bugSolution.html` to see the corrected code and proper rendering.

## Bug Explanation

The problem in `bug.html` is the missing closing tag for the `div` element. HTML requires that each opening tag have a corresponding closing tag.  Browsers attempt to interpret the code but may produce unexpected results because the structure is not well-formed.

## Solution

The solution, found in `bugSolution.html`, simply adds the missing closing `&lt;/div&gt;` tag.
